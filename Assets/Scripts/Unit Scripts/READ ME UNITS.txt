THE UNIT SYSTEM BASICS

Requirements: 
4 Scripts (1 Singleton)
2 Layers

UC = UNIT CLICK - SYSTEM SCRIPT
UD = UNIT DRAG - SYSTEM  SCRIPT
US = UNIT SELECTION - SYSTEM  SCRIPT

U = UNIT SCRIPT


When you click you use the UC Script
When you drag you use the UD Script 

If you want anything to be selected when you click or drag. 

Then those system MUST do it. 

IF ITS NOT SELECTED THE PROBLEM LIES IN THOSE SCRIPTS.

When you Select Anything then your automaticlly using the Selection System.

Meaning that if you can't select for some reason ( Bugs ) 
then it's not the Selection Systems fault 99.99% of the time.
