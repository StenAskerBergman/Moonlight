BuildingButton.cs

BuildingButton.cs sits on every building button ingame and hold the prefab reference 
for what building the player is currently trying to place. It should contain a method 
to tell BuildingSelector.cs what building is currently being selected by the player 
to be placed by referencing the buildings prefab which will be used by the building 
selector as reference for the building preview. 



BuildingSelector.cs

BuildingSelector.cs handles the current selected building using its prefab. This script 
determines using on click events what the player wants to place. Thats why it should 
contain a method to obtain what building button prefab it recieved based on the player's 
input. And why it is the node that will determine if the player "cancels building", That 
way we don't overcomplicate later steps and can simply set some value based on current 
or future inputs that cancels building preview if requested or need be.



BuildingPreview.cs

BuildingPreview.cs handles the creation and movement of the building preview object 
that represents the building the player wants to place ( in accordance to each island 
gridsystems). It should contain a method for setting the building prefab based on the 
building type or prefab selected in BuildingSelector.cs and the building preview 
movement is based on the players mouse input. 



BuildingMover.cs

BuildingMover.cs handles the movement of the building preview object based on the 
player's mouse position. It should contain a method for setting the preview object 
that it needs to move.



BuildingPlacer.cs

BuildingPlacer.cs handles checking the placement conditions and requirements for the 
actual building using the building previews current location when asked. It should 
contain a method for checking the building for placement and instantiate the actual 
final building onto the correct parent in the hierarchy. After placing a building the 
building will need to have the correct properties this is a check that needs to be 
performed before one can say that the building system is completely done.



BuildingManager.cs

BuildingManager.cs handles all the buildings various potential interactions, like on 
click menus, events, conditions or other states that a building can possess. On top of 
that it's a dynamic script which will be active during run time to manage the buildings 
various other building functionalities.



BuildingProperties.cs

BuildingProperties.cs handles all the buildings various properties, building stats and 
current building stats which all needs to be maintained and tracked for the various in 
game systems in order for the game to properly function. 



BuildingRotator.cs 

BuildingRotator.cs handle the rotation of the preview building object which is the 
default orientation which the BuildingPlacer will place using. 

Prefabs:
> Select Building (Loose Substitute Term for every building selectable)
> Preview Building (Generic GameObject with the intended function)
